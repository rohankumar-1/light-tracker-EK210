# EK210 Light Tracking Project

By David Moody, Sora Kakigi, Brennan Mahoney, and Rohan Kumar

The purpose of this project is to create a system to track head movement using light sensing. This system can then further be utilized to move a cursor around a computer screen without the use of hands, in order to facilitate better quality of life for those with limited dexterity.

This repository includes all of the code that will be imported onto an Arduino Uno and ran in order to collect the sensor data, calculate position, and print to an external LCD display.
